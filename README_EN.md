# Project C++

This project is a mini game that makes play, at least two players and players can be either human or robot. 
The goal is to enter an alphabetical letter, however players must avoid completing an existing word otherwise they will score points. 
The first person who reaches the maximum score loses the game. 
In addition, words come from a text file that contains words, so you can customize this dico by putting selected words.

To do this, we used Visual Studio 2019 and Clion and the principle of modular programming to work in the best conditions. 
This is why our program has several files.

If you use this project on Clion, you may have problems with the dictionary.
